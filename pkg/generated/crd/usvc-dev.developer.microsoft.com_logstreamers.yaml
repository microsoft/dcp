          The sole purpose of the LogStreamer existence is that a Kubernetes storage object
          (LogStorage for DCP logs) must be associated with an object (type) that it stores.
          Otherwise, resource_rest.ResourceStreamer instance would be sufficient for what we need to do.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.
